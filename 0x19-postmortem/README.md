 Postmortem Report: Network Failure in Nigeria March 2024.
Duration of the outage:
- Start: around 14/03/2024, 12:30 PM
- End: around 16/03/2024, 8:00 PM

- 
Impact: The incident had several adverse effects on my learning and project work:
•	Disrupted Learning: The inability to access my learning dashboard prevented me from participating in scheduled activities, accessing course materials, and interacting with instructors and classmates, ultimately impacting my learning progress.
•	Delayed Project Work: As the network failure coincided with a critical phase of my project, the disruption in connectivity hindered my ability to conduct research, communicate with collaborators, and make progress on project tasks, resulting in delays and setbacks.
Root cause:
•	The root cause of the network failure was as a result the breakage of the undersea cable of cable network


Background: The incident occurred on March 14th, at approximately 12:30 PM, when a widespread network failure impacted all data networks in Nigeria. As a result, users across the country, including myself, were denied access to various online platforms and services, including my learning dashboard. The outage persisted for approximately two days, until March 16th when services were restored.


Incident Description: The network failure had a significant impact on my ability to access essential online resources, particularly my learning dashboard, which I rely on for accessing course materials, assignments, and collaboration with peers. Additionally, as I was concurrently working on a project that required online research and collaboration, the outage severely disrupted my workflow and productivity.


Impact: The incident had several adverse effects on my learning and project work:
o	Disrupted Learning: The inability to access my learning dashboard prevented me from participating in scheduled activities, accessing course materials, and interacting with instructors and classmates, ultimately impacting my learning progress.


o	Delayed Project Work: As the network failure coincided with a critical phase of my project, the disruption in connectivity hindered my ability to conduct research, communicate with collaborators, and make progress on project tasks, resulting in delays and setbacks.


Root Cause Analysis: Upon investigation, the following factors contributed to the severity and duration of the incident:
o	Infrastructure Vulnerabilities: Nigeria's telecommunications infrastructure faces challenges such as inadequate maintenance, aging equipment, and insufficient redundancy, making it susceptible to failures during periods of high demand or adverse conditions.

o	External Factors: The network failure may have been exacerbated by external factors such as severe weather conditions, power outages, or technical issues with upstream providers, further complicating efforts to restore services.
o	Lack of Communication: Limited communication and transparency from service providers regarding the cause and resolution of the outage exacerbated user frustration and uncertainty during the incident.
Lessons Learned:
o	Diversify Access Channels: Explore alternative methods for accessing critical resources, such as offline materials or mobile data connections, to mitigate the impact of network failures on learning and project work.
o	Proactive Communication: Improve communication channels between service providers and users during incidents, providing timely updates, status reports, and estimated restoration times to manage expectations and alleviate concerns.
o	Enhance Infrastructure Resilience: Advocate for investments in infrastructure upgrades, redundancy measures, and disaster recovery plans to enhance the resilience and reliability of telecommunications networks in Nigeria.

Recommendations:
o	Advocate for Policy Changes: Advocate for regulatory reforms and policies aimed at improving the resilience and reliability of Nigeria's telecommunications infrastructure, including incentives for infrastructure investments and performance standards for service providers.
o	Collaborate with Stakeholders: Foster collaboration between government agencies, service providers, and industry stakeholders to address systemic challenges and develop comprehensive solutions for improving network resilience and performance.
o	Emergency Preparedness: Develop and implement emergency preparedness plans and protocols to effectively respond to future network failures or disruptions, including clear escalation procedures, communication strategies, and coordination mechanisms.
Conclusion: The network failure incident in Nigeria underscored the critical importance of reliable connectivity for learning, work, and daily activities in today's digital age. By conducting a thorough postmortem analysis, identifying root causes, and implementing recommendations, we can work towards building more resilient telecommunications infrastructure and better preparedness for future incidents, ultimately ensuring uninterrupted access to essential services and resources for all users.
